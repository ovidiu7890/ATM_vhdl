## Overview

This project implements a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system on a Nexys A7 FPGA board. 
The system allows a user to:

- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Check their account balance

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with hardware-level design using VHDL and to deepen understanding of digital systems and hardware behavior.

## Features

- Simple user interface through switches and 7-segment display
- VHDL-based design with modular architecture
- Synchronous operations for accurate state handling
